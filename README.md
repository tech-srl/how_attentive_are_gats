# How Attentive are Graph Attention Networks?

This repository is the official implementation of [How Attentive are Graph Attention Networks?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.14491.pdf). 

Appeared in **ICLR'2022**

Since our experiments (Section 4) are based on different frameworks, this repository is divided into several sub-projects:
1. The subdirectory `arxiv_mag_products_collab_citation2_noise` contains the needed files to reproduce the results of 
Node-Prediction, Link-Prediction, and Robustness to Noise (Tables 2a, 3 and Figure 4).
2. The subdirectory `proteins` contains the needed files to reproduce the results of ogbn-proteins in Node-Prediction (Table 2b).
3. The subdirectory `dictionary_lookup` contains the need files to reproduce the results of the DictionaryLookup benchmark (Figure 3).
4. The subdirectory `tf-gnn-samples` contains the needed files to reproduce the results of the VarMisuse and QM9 datasets 
(Table 1 and Table 4).

### Requirements
Each subdirectory contains its own requirements and dependencies.

Generally, all subdirectories depend on PyTorch 1.7.1 and [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/) version 1.7.0 (`proteins` depends on [DGL](https://www.dgl.ai/) version 0.6.0).
The subdirectory `tf-gnn-samples` (VarMisuse and QM9) depends on TensorFlow 1.13. 

### Hardware
In general, all experiments can run on either GPU or CPU.
